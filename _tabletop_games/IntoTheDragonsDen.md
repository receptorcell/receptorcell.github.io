## Description

**Into The Dragons Den \| Match-A-Quest** is a tile matching / memory game for the whole family.

Players take on the role of villagers trying to reclaim treasure stolen by a group of dragons.
The player with the most coin earned for their treasure at the end of the game wins!

* Reclaim treasure by matching tile pairs
* 23 different treasures to reclaim
* 4 playable kingdoms (Red / Green / Blue / Black)
* Team up with villagers from same kingdoms
* Complete individual quests to earn extra coin
* Stay away from the dragons breath (otherwise you will lose an already reclaimed treasure)
* Find all 4 dragons to end the round (earning extra coin & hopefully keeping your reclaimed treasure)
* Play 1 to 6 rounds (approximately 15 minutes per round)

## Story

You are one of several villagers that have banded together in hope of reclaiming treasure stolen by a group of dragons. You've been promised various amounts of coin if you can find the treasure and return it to your kingdom. But keep watch of other villagers, for although you agreed to join this group because there is strength in numbers, others may be in it just for the promise of coin earned for treasures returned to their very own kingdoms.

## Objective

To be the villager who has earned the most coin for their reclaimed treasures at the end of the game.

Some treasure tile examples:

![Gold Treasure Tile]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/projects/tabletop_games/into_the_dragons_den/TileGoldInvisibilityCloak.png)

## Gameplay

Players take turns trying to match tile pairs to reclaim treasure and earn coin when the treasure is returned to their kingdom at the end of a round. 

* Gold treasure are worth 3 coin each and all other treasure are worth 1 coin each. 
* Matching helmet/sword/shield treasure to kingdom gem icons earn extra coin. 
* Note: it's a good thing to have reclaimed an Invisibility Cloak treasure.

Stay away from the Dragons Breath... matching of these tiles will cause you to lose your most valuable reclaimed treasure.

A round ends when all four Dragons have been found. The player who ends the round needs to have a Shield treasure to protect everyone, otherwise players may lose all their reclaimed treasure for the round.
