## Description

**Into The Dragons Den \| Match-A-Quest** is a tile matching / memory game that is fun for the whole family.

Players take on the role of villagers trying to reclaim treasure stolen by a group of dragons.
The player with the most coin earned for their treasure at the end of the game wins!

* Reclaim treasure (and earn coins) by matching tile pairs
* 23 different treasures to reclaim
* 4 playable kingdoms (Red/Green/Blue/Black)
* Team up with villagers from the same kingdom
* Complete individual quests to earn extra coins
* Stay away from the dragons breath (otherwise you will lose an already reclaimed treasure)
* Find all 4 dragons to end the round (earning extra coins & hopefully keeping your reclaimed treasure)
* Play 1 to 6 rounds (approximately 15 minutes per round)

## Story

You are one of several villagers that have banded together in hope of reclaiming treasure stolen by a group of dragons. You've been promised various amounts of coin if you can find the treasure and return it to your kingdom. But keep watch of other villagers, for although you agreed to join this group because there is strength in numbers, others may be in it just for the promise of coin earned for treasures returned to their very own kingdoms.

## Objective

To be the villager who has earned the most coin for their reclaimed treasures at the end of the game.

Some treasure tile examples:

## Gameplay

Players take turns trying to match tile pairs to reclaim treasure and earn coin when the treasure is returned to their kingdom at the end of a round. 

* Coins are earned for treasure returned to a villager's kingdom at the end of each round.  
* Gold treasure is worth 3 coins and all other treasure is worth 1 coin (however, sword/shield/helmet treasures can potentially earn an extra coin each).
* Reclaimed treasure covered by the Dragon's Breath cannot be used and earn no coins.
* The King's Chalice and Queen's Crown earn one extra turn each (taken immediately when found).
* The Invisibility Cloak protects a villagers' treasure from the dragons at the end of a round.
* A round ends when all 4 dragons have been found.
* The villager that finds the dragons earns an extra 5 coins and, if they have a shield treasure, protect all villagers so they can escape with their reclaimed treasure.  Without a shield treasure, only villagers that have found the Invisibility Cloak treasure escape with all their reclaimed treasure.
* Coins are collected for reclaimed treasure and the next round ("a journey back into the dragon's den") may begin.
* The game ends when no more rounds are to be played.  The total amount of coins earned for all rounds is added up and the villager with the most coins wins!

<!-- Players take turns trying to match tile pairs to reclaim treasure and earn coin when the treasure is returned to their kingdom at the end of a round. 

* Gold treasure are worth 3 coin each and all other treasure are worth 1 coin each. 
* Matching helmet/sword/shield treasure to kingdom gem icons earn extra coin. 
* Note: it's a good thing to have reclaimed an Invisibility Cloak treasure.

Stay away from the Dragons Breath... matching of these tiles will cause you to lose your most valuable reclaimed treasure.

A round ends when all four Dragons have been found. The player who ends the round needs to have a Shield treasure to protect everyone, otherwise players may lose all their reclaimed treasure for the round.  -->
